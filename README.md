## Overview

This project reads a CSV file containing financial data and performs data cleaning. The cleaned data is then saved into a new CSV file, which can be used for analysis and visualization, such as in Power BI.

## Requirements

- JDK 22 or higher
- Maven (optional, if you are using Maven to manage dependencies)
- Apache Commons CSV library (for CSV processing)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karinamigotto/FinancialDataProcessor.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd FinancialDataProcessor
   ```

3. **Compile the project (if you are using Maven):**

   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```

4. **Make sure you have the Apache Commons CSV library added to your project. If using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:**

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
       <artifactId>commons-csv</artifactId>
       <version>1.10.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

## Usage

1. **Place the CSV file with financial data in the projectâ€™s input directory.**

2. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   java -cp target/classes;path/to/commons-csv-1.10.0.jar FinancialDataProcessor
   ```

   Replace `path/to/commons-csv-1.10.0.jar` with the path to the Apache Commons CSV JAR file.

3. **The program will process the CSV file and create a new file with cleaned data.**
